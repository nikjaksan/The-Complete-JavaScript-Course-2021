      <p>
        The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the
        only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to
        as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the
        family.

        The dog or domestic dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, and is
        characterized by an upturning tail. The dog is derived from an ancient,
        extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
